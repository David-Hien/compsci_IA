# Unit IA: Client Project (Club Attendance Application)

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
The badminton club leaders have to mark attendance for all members every time they practice badminton. Currently, they use google sheets, which turn out to be very hard to use, especially when used in the gym with limited wifi. To streamline the process, the badminton club leaders have approached me to create an application that can efficiently record who's present and who's not. They want an application that has a GUI that has accessible buttons and textboxes to input attendance, and must work even without the internet.
