# Unit IA: Client Project (Club Attendance Application)

# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
The badminton club leaders have to mark attendance for all members every time they practice badminton. Currently, they use google sheets, which turn out to be very hard to use, especially when used in the gym with limited wifi. To streamline the process, the badminton club leaders have approached me to create an application that can efficiently record who's present and who's not. They want an application that has a GUI that has accessible buttons and textboxes to input attendance, and must work even without the internet. The client also wants a record of all the data inputted to check back later on. 

## Proposed Solution:

### Design Statement
I will design and make an application that will keep track of the list of students and their attendance for the badminton club leaders. The application will be able to keep track of all previous data (student list and attendance) through the use of a database and a login system. To ensure security and privacy, the login system will have a hashing system to secure everyone's password and will all be saved in a local database using SQLite. The application will have a GUI so that my client can easily guide themselves throughout the app. This all will be created using the Python 3.x language with the help of KivyMD for GUI construction. All code will be created and developed on the application, Pycharm. This app will take 4 weeks to complete and will be evaluated according to the criteria.
